1. Executive Summary
Project Focus: This project was built to understand how quantitative signals behave once realistic execution, liquidity and risk constraints are applied, with a strong focus on risk management rather than pure alpha maximization.
This document presents a comprehensive quantitative trading system designed for systematic equity portfolio management. The system combines multiple alpha factors with dynamic risk management and liquidity-aware position sizing to generate risk-adjusted returns across varying market conditions.
The pipeline implements a hybrid signal approach, combining 70% daily strategic signals with 30% hourly tactical timing signals. Five distinct alpha factors (Volatility, Momentum, Tail Risk, Beta, and Carry) are weighted dynamically using correlation-aware optimization, with real SPY benchmark data for accurate signal calculation.
Key Features
Feature	Description
Hybrid Signal System	70% daily signals + 30% hourly timing optimization
Alpha Factors	5 signals: Volatility, Momentum, Tail Risk, Beta, Carry
Real Benchmark	Uses actual SPY returns (not approximations)
Liquidity Constraints	Maximum 10% of 20-day ADV per position
Dynamic Leverage	1.0x to 3.0x based on signal confidence
Dual-Broker	Alpaca for data, Interactive Brokers for execution

 
2. System Architecture
The trading pipeline is built on a modular architecture separating concerns between data acquisition, signal processing, risk management, and order execution.
Component Overview
Component	File	Responsibility
Trading Engine	paper_trading.py	Main loop, rebalancing, liquidity checks
Signal Pipeline	enhanced_pipeline.py	Factor computation, backtesting, optimization
Hybrid Fusion	hybrid_pipeline_weighted.py	Multi-timeframe + benchmark alignment
Broker Adapter	dual_broker_adapter.py	Unified interface for data and execution
IBKR Integration	ibkr_adapter.py	Interactive Brokers API wrapper

Data Flow
1. Market Data: Alpaca API provides 10 years of daily bars, 2 years of hourly bars, plus real SPY returns for benchmark calculations.
2. Signal Generation: The enhanced pipeline computes 5 alpha factors using real benchmark data and optimizes weights via correlation-aware objective.
3. Position Sizing: Target positions are calculated with both portfolio constraints AND liquidity constraints (10% of 20-day ADV).
4. Order Execution: IBKR handles actual trade execution, bypassing PDT restrictions available on Alpaca.
 
3. Signal Processing
Real Benchmark Integration
A key improvement in this system is the use of actual SPY returns instead of approximations. The system fetches real SPY data and aligns it with individual stock returns for accurate momentum and beta calculations.
Alpha Factors
Volatility Signal
Mean-reversion strategy on realized volatility z-scores. When volatility spikes above historical norms, the signal goes short, expecting mean reversion. The signal is amplified by volatility-of-volatility to increase conviction during regime changes.
Momentum Signal (with Real Benchmark)
Combines absolute momentum (20-day vs 60-day returns) with relative strength versus the real SPY benchmark. The 70/30 weighting favors excess returns over simple price momentum. Using actual market returns ensures accurate relative performance measurement.
Tail Risk Signal
Based on Expected Shortfall (CVaR at 5th percentile) adjusted by tail asymmetry. Positions against extreme downside risk while accounting for the shape of the return distribution.
Beta Signal (with Real Benchmark)
Rolling 60-day beta calculated against real SPY returns, multiplied by beta volatility. Goes short when market sensitivity is high and unstable, reducing systematic risk exposure during uncertain periods.
Carry Signal
Composite of Volatility Risk Premium proxy (50%), mean reversion to 252-day moving average (30%), and annual seasonality (20%). Captures multiple sources of expected return.
Risk Budget Allocation
Factor	Weight	Rationale
Momentum	30%	Strongest historical predictive power
Carry	25%	Stable premium, low correlation
Volatility	20%	Mean reversion reliability
Tail Risk	15%	Crash protection value
Beta	10%	Market timing component

 
4. Risk Management
Liquidity-Aware Position Sizing
A critical enhancement is the implementation of liquidity constraints. Each position is capped at 10% of the 20-day Average Daily Volume (ADV), preventing market impact and ensuring executable trades.
Position Limits
Parameter	Value
Maximum Position Size	20% of portfolio per asset
Maximum Gross Leverage	3.0x equity
Maximum Net Leverage	1.5x equity
Liquidity Cap (NEW)	10% of 20-day ADV
Position Buffer Zone	15% change threshold

Drawdown Controls
Threshold	Level	Action
Daily Loss Warning	-5%	Alert, reduce new positions
Daily Loss Limit	-10%	Halt new positions
Max Drawdown	-15%	Flatten 50% of portfolio
Stop Loss	-20%	Full liquidation

Tail Hedging Mechanism
The system implements a stateful tail hedge that activates during market stress. When portfolio drawdown exceeds -5%, the hedge provides convex protection with a payoff proportional to (downside)^1.5. This provides increasing protection during severe market declines while limiting cost during normal conditions.
 
5. Stress Testing
The pipeline includes comprehensive stress testing against 6 historical crisis scenarios. Each scenario injects realistic crash dynamics including magnitude, duration, and volatility multipliers.
Scenario	Crash	Duration	Vol x	Description
Black Monday 1987	-20%	1 day	5x	Flash crash
LTCM Crisis 1998	-15%	5 days	3x	Liquidity crisis
Dot-com 2000	-30%	20 days	2.5x	Bubble burst
Financial Crisis 2008	-40%	60 days	4x	Systemic crisis
Flash Crash 2010	-10%	1 day	10x	Algo crash
COVID Crash 2020	-35%	15 days	6x	Pandemic shock
